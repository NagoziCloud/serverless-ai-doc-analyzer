# serverless-ai-doc-analyzer


Overview
The Serverless AI Document Analyzer is an end-to-end, serverless application built on AWS that automates the ingestion, processing, and summarization of documents using advanced AI capabilities. It is designed to streamline document handling workflows such as resume screening, report analysis, or application review without requiring manual intervention.

Key AWS services used include:

AWS Lambda for scalable, event-driven compute functions

AWS S3 for secure, durable document storage

AWS Bedrock for AI-driven document summarization and natural language understanding

AWS DynamoDB for fast, NoSQL storage of analysis results

This project leverages AWS free-tier resources wherever possible and follows Infrastructure as Code (IaC) best practices using CloudFormation or AWS SAM.

Features
Fully Serverless Architecture: No servers to manage, with auto-scaling Lambda functions triggered by document uploads.

AI-Powered Summarization: Utilizes AWS Bedrock’s foundation models to extract key insights and summaries from various document formats.

Multi-Format Support: Accepts PDF, DOCX, TXT, and other common document types.

Persistent Storage: Stores processed summaries, metadata, and analysis in DynamoDB for fast retrieval.

Event-Driven Workflow: Documents uploaded to S3 trigger Lambda functions automatically.

Extensible Integration: Designed to be extended with APIs or other AWS services for further processing (e.g., resume screening tools).

Secure: Implements IAM roles and policies with least privilege access.

Deployment Instructions
1. Clone the repository
bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/serverless-ai-document-analyzer.git
cd serverless-ai-document-analyzer
2. Deploy infrastructure
Use AWS CloudFormation or AWS SAM to deploy all necessary resources.

CloudFormation:
bash
aws cloudformation deploy \
  --template-file infra/template.yaml \
  --stack-name ServerlessDocumentAnalyzer \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
SAM CLI (if using SAM):

sam build
sam deploy --guided
3. Configure environment variables and permissions
Ensure Lambda functions have environment variables set (e.g., DynamoDB table name, Bedrock endpoint) and that IAM roles allow access to required AWS services.

4. Upload documents
Upload sample or real documents to the configured S3 bucket via AWS Console, AWS CLI, or programmatically. This triggers the Lambda function.

bash

aws s3 cp ./json/sample_resume.pdf s3://your-document-analyzer-bucket/
Lambda Function Workflow (Detailed)
Trigger: A new document upload to the S3 bucket triggers the Lambda function.

Fetch Document: Lambda downloads the document from S3.

Preprocessing: Converts or extracts text from the document as needed (e.g., PDF to text).

AI Summarization: Sends extracted text to AWS Bedrock AI models for summarization and key insight extraction.

Store Results: Summarized data and metadata (timestamp, document ID, source info) are saved in DynamoDB.

Logging and Monitoring: Uses CloudWatch logs for troubleshooting and performance tracking.

Supported Document Types
PDF (.pdf)

Microsoft Word (.docx)

Plain Text (.txt)

(Extendable to other formats with preprocessing)

Testing
Sample documents are available in the json/ folder.

You can simulate uploads via the AWS CLI or SDK to trigger the workflow.

Use CloudWatch Logs to review Lambda execution details.

Query DynamoDB to validate stored summaries.

Future Enhancements
Add a REST API Gateway to expose summaries via HTTP endpoints.

Integrate with resume screening or HR tools.

Add user authentication and access control.

Support additional AI analysis like sentiment detection or entity extraction.

Implement batch processing for bulk document analysis.

Troubleshooting
Lambda Timeout: Increase timeout in Lambda configuration for larger documents.

Permission Errors: Verify IAM roles and policies have correct permissions.

Bedrock API Errors: Check API endpoint configurations and AWS Bedrock service limits.

Document Format Issues: Ensure uploaded files are supported and not corrupted.
